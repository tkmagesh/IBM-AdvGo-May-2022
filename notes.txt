Basics:
    Higher-order functions
    
    Consumption or resources
    Is OOPS supported?
    Using 3rd party libraries
    Code Organization
    Concurrency

Go:
    No classes (only structs)
    No inheritance (only composition)
    No access modifiers (only naming convention)
    No exceptions (only errors)
    No reference types (everything is a value in go)
    No implicity type conversions
    There can be more than one return results from a function

Higher Order Functions (functions as data)
    Assign functions as values to variables
    Pass functions as arguments
    Return unctions as results from functions

Concurrency

    To detect data races
        go run --race <program.go>
