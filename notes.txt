About You
    Name
    Total Experience
    Experience in Go
    Have you attended my "Go Basics" course?

Methodology:
    No powerpoint

Repository:
    https://github.com/tkmagesh/ibm-advgo-may-2022

Basics:
    Higher-order functions
    
    Consumption or resources
    Is OOPS supported?
    Using 3rd party libraries
    Code Organization
    Concurrency

Go:
    No classes (only structs)
    No inheritance (only composition)
    No access modifiers (only naming convention)
    No exceptions (only errors)
    No reference types (everything is a value in go)
    No implicity type conversions
    There can be more than one return results from a function

Higher Order Functions (functions as data)
    Assign functions as values to variables
    Pass functions as arguments
    Return unctions as results from functions

Concurrency

    To detect data races
        go run --race <program.go>

    Channel
        Data type in go
        Used for concurrency safe communication between goroutines

        var ch chan int
        ch = make(chan int)

        channel operation ( <- )

        Send Operation
            ch <- 100

        Receive Operation
            val := <- ch

    
    Channels
        A "Receive" operation is ALWAYS blocking operation

        A "Send" operation is blocked until a "receive" operation is initiated (conditions apply)

    Concurrency Patterns
        Worker
        Pool
        Runner


gRPC
    http2
        real-time communication
    binary serialization
        protocol buffers

    Communiation Pattern
        Request & Response
        Server Streaming (One request & multiple responses)
        Client Streaming (multiple requests & one response)
        Bidirectional Streaming (multiple requests & multiple responses)

    Steps
        Define the following contracts
            Service Contract
            Operation Contracts
            Data Contracts

        Generate the Proxy & Stub
        Implement the service and host it using the Stub
        Client communicates using the proxy

    Installation
        go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@latest
        go install google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc@latest

        (when the above is installed, executables are created in the gopath/bin folder. Make sure this path is set in environment variables)

        Windows
            Install the binaries from https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/

        Mac
            brew install protoc-gen-go
            brew install protoc-gen-go-grpc

    Installation verification
        protoc --version

    To generate the proxy and stub (run the command in the application folder)
    protoc --go_out=. --go_opt=paths=source_relative --go-grpc_out=. --go-grpc_opt=paths=source_relative proto/service.proto

    To install the dependencies
        go mod tidy
